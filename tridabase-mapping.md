# NOTES -  Peter Brewer - 8th Nov 2016 

 The following table can be used as a mapping between the original DCCD object/element type
 dictionary with the new DCCD/ARIADNE controlled vocabulary.  The list is based upon the 
 dictionary used in TRiDaBASE and therefore differs a litte from the Excel multi-lingual dictionary
 placed on the DCCD VKC. 

 Most records in DCCD should be matched using the normalid, term and lang values in this table 
 and be mapped to the DCCD/ARIADNE controlled vocabulary using the conceptuuid.

 Records in this list without a conceptuuid mapping are unused in the DCCD and have been determined to be
 superfluous 

 DCCD does allow for non-standardised terms too.  Where possible these have been accommodated here.
 Such terms will not have a normalid and thus should be matched using a simple text match with the term
 field. There will no doubt be a handful of terms in the DCCD that require manual mapping to the new 
 vocabulary.
